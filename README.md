I am very much interested in learning new things. Back in my childhood days I used to play around with the toys and some things and used disassemble them and again I used to put everything back. The main reason I have chosen CSE as my stream because of my interest towards the computers. I am also very much interested in how the we can operate things from anywhere in the world.
